In the Spring 2025 semester, I took Ciscovering Computer Science: Scientific Data and Dynamics (CS111). For the final project, I wrote a series of functions that generated graphs based on economic models I learned in another class I was taking, Intermediate Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON 301). The following is from my final project report.

Introduction: 

No subjects exist in a vacuum, especially computer science. Coding can be implemented into a huge range of domains to streamline tasks and significantly improve efficiency. Economics is just one subject that computer science skills complement. In economics, models and graphs are heavily used to find trends and make generalized predictions. While many of the formulas and graphs used in this project seem absurdly simple, they are still quite successful at describing past and current economies. In this project, I used my skills in Python to simplify the process of implementing and visualizing models
